## Whiteboarding


### Why Whiteboarding in tech interviewing?
- Problem-solving skills 
- Ability to adapt to mistakes 
- Ability to collaborate 
- Critical thinking without relying on tech tools 

### Whiteboarding Dos:
- Ask questions (it's okay to clarify or follow-up on the problem) 
- Share your problem solving methods aloud
- Ask for feedback 
- Share areas of challenge. Discuss the challenge, and explain how you're trying to solve it. 
- Prepare: practice with a colleague, friend, or yourself. 
- Keep a list of potential questions 
- Stay confident in yourself. You may not feel confident in your solution, but remember that your core strengths in problem solving are more important than the solution. 
- Embrace being uncomfortable. 

### Whiteboarding Don'ts: 
- Don't let frustration or confusion take hold. If you feel frustrated, take a pause. Communicate your roadblock and discuss different ways you might approach overcoming it. 
- Don't overcomplicate the problem. You may not consider or cover everything- just get started somewhere. 

Practice Problems: 

Below are some logic problems that may get your brain thinking in the right direction for a Whiteboarding activity. Remember, it is not
all about solving a probelm accurately, first try, but in how you think and talk through a problem. Whiteboarding may be one of the most
difficult aspects of an interview and is one that is argued as to its fairness in the industry, but it exists nonetheless...remember, these companies have reachout out to you for an interview most likely as a junior developer that will be trained within the company. Show
them you can think and problem solve and strike up good dialogue during this part of the interview and the interviewer would be smart to 
hire you because you are AWESOME!


## Warm up 

- Return the number of even ints in a given array

## Moderate

- Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array
- Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 
(every 6 will be followed by at least one 7) Return 0 for no numbers


## Challenging

- Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {2, 5, 3, 6}
- Given arrays nums1 and nums2 of the same length, for every element in nums1, consider the corresponding element in nums2 
(at the same index). Return the count of the number of times that the two elements differ by 2 or less, but are not equal.
- Given start and end numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to but not including end,
so start=5 and end=10 yields {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.The end number will be greater or equal to the start number. 
Note that a length-0 array is valid
