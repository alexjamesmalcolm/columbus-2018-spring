## Opportunity Characteristics Inventory
Your opportunity characteristics inventory is a starting point to start determining where you will eventually target your networking and job search efforts.  By determining what characteristics of a work environment and organization are important to you, you’ll be able to focus your energy towards finding the perfect place for you to land.  

## Discussion Questions
- What factors are most important to you personally about an organization?  (Location, culture, mission, size, etc?)
- What type of environment do you work most effectively in?  What environments have you worked in previously where you were happiest and most productive?  Which weren’t ideal for your work style and personality?
- Are there any non-negotiables in your characteristics list?  Something an employer must offer, or must not do, for you to be willing to accept a position at their organization?
